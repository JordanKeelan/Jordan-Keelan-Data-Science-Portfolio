## [Modeling NHL Goalie Save Percentages Based on Player Attributes](https://github.com/JordanKeelan/NHL_Goalie_Multiple_Linear_Regression)
* Multiple Linear Regression Model, written in R, that predicts what a individual goalies save percentage will be based on their attributes
* Used data visualization (ggplot) and statistical analysis to identify cutoff values for 'games played' to improve consistency
* Manually conducted backward elimination model selection, resulting in valid interactive model that outperformed autometed step-wise selection in RMSE and $R^{2}_{adj}$
* Conducted model diagnostics ensuring satisfaction of Linearity, Independence, Equal Variance, Normality of Residuals, Multicolinearity, and Outlier assumptions.
* [Presented findings in accomanied PDF](https://github.com/JordanKeelan/NHL_Goalie_Multiple_Linear_Regression/blob/main/DATA%20603-L02%20Group%201%20Project%20-%20Fall22%20-%20NHL%20Goalies.pdf)
