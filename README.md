# Jordan Keelan: MDSA Project Portfolio

## [Modeling NHL Goalie Save Percentages Based on Player Attributes](https://github.com/JordanKeelan/NHL_Goalie_Multiple_Linear_Regression)
* **Multiple Linear Regression Model**, written in R, that predicts what a individual goalies save percentage will be based on their attributes
* Used data visualization (ggplot) and statistical analysis to identify cutoff values for 'games played' to improve consistency
* Manually conducted backward elimination model selection, resulting in valid interactive model that outperformed autometed step-wise selection in RMSE and $R^{2}_{adj}$
* Conducted model diagnostics ensuring satisfaction of Linearity, Independence, Equal Variance, Normality of Residuals, Multicolinearity, and Outlier assumptions.
* [Findings presented in accomanied PDF](https://github.com/JordanKeelan/NHL_Goalie_Multiple_Linear_Regression/blob/main/DATA%20603-L02%20Group%201%20Project%20-%20Fall22%20-%20NHL%20Goalies.pdf)

## [Statistical Comparison of Environmental Effects on Alberta Emergency Shelter Occupancy](https://github.com/JordanKeelan/Alberta_Emergency_Shelter_Occupancy_Statistical_Analysis)
* Statistical Analysis using R, two topics investigated:
  1. Has the covid-19 pandemic created a significant increase in emergency shleter occupancy? Has it increased the quantity of people experiencing homelessness?
  2. Did the COVID-19 pandemic result in a greater proportion of women seeking emergency shelter compared to other the 2014 oil downturn?
    * [Reporting on 'Shadow Pandemic' of increased domestic violence during covid lockdowns.](https://www.alberta.ca/article-the-shadow-pandemic.aspx)
* A Simple Linear Regression Model was employed to determine a trend in emergency shelter occupancy rates, to 95% confidence, and compared to actual values recorded.
* Analysis of Difference of Proportion carried out to identify statistically significant increased in womans shelter occupancy in the first 12 months of the Covid-19 lockdown compared to first 12 months of 2014 downturn.
* Dataset cleaning and transformations done in R
* [Findings presented in accomanied PDF](https://github.com/JordanKeelan/Alberta_Emergency_Shelter_Occupancy_Statistical_Analysis/blob/main/Data%20602%20Project.docx.pdf)
