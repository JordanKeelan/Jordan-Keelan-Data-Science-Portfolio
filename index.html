                As a passionate data professional, I am fascinated by the ways businesses and industries can leverage
                data to gain insights, optimize processes, and remain competitive. My Master of Data Science and
                Analytics from the University of Calgary has equipped me with the necessary skills to analyze and
                interpret data effectively. In my attached portfolio, you'll find several projects that showcase my
                abilities. I look forward to adding to this collection as I complete additional projects in the field.
                Thank you for your consideration.

                  I wrote this to because I found a very interesting dataset provided by the Food and Agriculture
                  Organization of the United Nations (FAOSTAT), FAOSTAT provides free access to food and agriculture
                  data for over 245 countries and territories and covers all FAO regional groupings from 1961 to the
                  most recent year available. Food and food security has always been a great passion of mine, and I
                  wanted to develop a greater understanding of where our food comes from, how food production has
                  changed, and what the effects of globalization and population growth have had on food production and
                  security.

              Here is an example visualization, highlighting the emergence of the oil palm in SE Asia. This answers the
              question "Has palm oil displaced crops, or expanded agricultural land requirements?"
              We can see from the chart that, while % of total land for rice and corn has reduced slightly, the land
              required for rice production has increased, while for corn it has remained quite stable. Leading to the
              conclusion that oil palm has expanded the total farmland in SE Asia.

                <p>
                  Writing a data visualization article was a rewarding experience, as it involved working with a
                  large dataset and presenting the data in a meaningful way. This dataset was originally wide form and
                  required me to melt the data, which makes it easier to work with and analyze. As well, the dataset had
                  significantly more data than was required to answer the questions I developed, so filtering and
                  adjusting units was key to the investigation.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Once the data has been prepared, it is important to choose the correct types of data visualization to
                  represent the ideas that are being communicated. This involves considering factors such as the type of
                  data, the purpose of the visualization, and the audience for the article. Creating effective
                  visualizations required knowledge of Tableau, and gave me the opportunity to explore its various
                  features.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Overall, writing a data visualization article requires a combination of technical skills,
                  creativity, and curiosity. By working with large datasets, understanding how to filter and manipulate
                  data, and
                  selecting the most effective types of visualization, authors can create engaging and informative
                  articles that effectively communicate complex ideas.

                  <p>As data becomes an increasingly crucial tool in the music industry, many music producers and
                    musicians are adopting a formulaic approach to music design. By breaking down successful or
                    unsuccessful songs into their fundamental elements and analyzing patterns influencing listener
                    emotions, they can leverage these findings in the creation of novel music. Understanding these song
                    features and how they contribute to popularity can help artists stay ahead of musical trends and
                    create more impactful music.</p>
                  <p>This project's purpose is to analyze the features of songs (as listed in the "Summary of Variables"
                    section above) and to develop multiple statistical models to determine the relevance of these
                    features to a song's popularity. This analysis will provide valuable insights into the music
                    industry and inform artists, music producers, and industry professionals on how to make informed
                    decisions to increase the popularity of their music.</p>

                  To address the problem at hand, we implemented four different models: two aimed at predicting
                  popularity as a continuous variable, and two aimed at determining whether a song could be classified
                  as a "hit" or not.</p>
                <p>
                  The first two models utilized were linear discriminant analysis and regression tree. For the
                  classification models, we employed classification tree and logistic regression. To make a clear
                  distinction between hits and non-hits, we assigned a score in the 75th percentile of popularity as the
                  threshold for a "hit." Any song with a popularity score above 42 out of 100 was considered a hit.</p>
                <p>
                  However, we encountered an imbalance in the training dataset, with a ratio of hits to non-hits of 1:3.
                  To address this issue, we applied down-sampling to even out the class distribution.</p>

                  Linear Discriminant Analysis to predict song popularity scores. While it showed equally promising
                  misclassification rates to the Classification Tree and Logistic Regression, we discarded it due to
                  failing to meet the Multivariate Normality and Equality of Variances assumptions.

                <p>
                  Turning to a Regression Tree Model to predict popularity scores, but it was only capable of predicting
                  scores of 20, 30, 40, and 50 with an RMSE of 15. Our analysis had a defined "hit" point of popularity
                  score > 42, which was the 75th percentile, so we had hoped to see more terminal nodes above that range
                  to feel that this model accomplished the goals of our investigation. Though we did balance the
                  training data for the classification models, we did not for regression models. Looking back, we think
                  that balancing for the regression models would have been beneficial. If we want a model that can
                  predict popularity from 0-100, having more equality across that spectrum in the training data would
                  likely have improved performance for our goals.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The classification models, Logistic Regression and Classification Tree, obtained similar
                  misclassification results. Initially we trained the models with 10-fold cross validation on the
                  unbalanced dataset, and we observed misclassification rates of 24.74% for the Classification Tree and
                  24.09% for Logistic Regression.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As we defined our distinction between a "hit" and "no-hit" to be the 75th percentile, we inherently
                  created unbalanced classes from which to train our classification models. As only 25% of songs were
                  considered "hits". To correct this, we implemented both up and down sampling techniques into our
                  custom "TrainControl()" functions. As both yielded near identical results, we used only down sampling
                  for the report. Once these classification models were performed on the balanced training folds,
                  Classification Tree and Logistic Regression saw increased misclassification rates to 35.06% and
                  33.33%, respectively.
                </p>

                  Balancing provided some interesting insight: with the unbalanced set, we saw that three of our methods
                  produced misclassification rates near the proportion of hits in the dataset, 25%. Following balancing
                  our classes in the training models, we saw an overall increase in misclassification rate, with an
                  increase in both type 1 and type 2 error. As we used the caret library to conduct this
                  cross-validation we were unable to determine if the method we used caused both training and testing to
                  be balanced, or just training. Perhaps if only the training data was down-sampled and predicted on a
                  test set that was heavily skewed to no-hits the worsening of the model could be explained.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In this situation, a false positive should be considered worse than a false negative. As a false
                  positive could cause a streaming service, or record label to invest in a song that is not going to be
                  a hit. Alternatively, not investing money in a song could mean missed opportunity but does not
                  directly cause loss of capital. So in the case of both classification models, type 1 error was
                  worsened.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Balancing training data for the Classification Tree improved the number of features used in modeling
                  beyond just loudness and explicitness, and we increased from 2 to 9 internal nodes. However, it had
                  poorer performance overall.

                  It's important to note that this dataset is produced by Spotify, with variables that it creates
                  through its own process. As such, it is a descriptive dataset and not optimized to predict popularity
                  with variables designed to cluster songs into playlists or reflect user preferences. We must remember
                  that popularity is not just a product of plays, it is assigned by Spoitfy's algorithm. It's worth
                  considering how much influence investment, business agreements/relationships, and artist image have on
                  song ratings.

                  What I learned from this report is the importance of careful model selection and variable selection in
                  machine learning. The report showed that different models can produce vastly different results, even
                  when applied to the same dataset. In this case, the classification models achieved similar results,
                  but the regression model was much less effective. This underscores the importance of selecting the
                  appropriate model for the problem at hand.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The report also highlighted the importance of variable selection, as certain features were found to be
                  more important than others in predicting the target variable. This suggests that careful consideration
                  of the relevance and importance of individual features is crucial for effective model building.
                  Moreover, it was shown that balancing training data can lead to different results, underscoring the
                  importance of assessing the impact of various data preprocessing and handling techniques on model
                  performance.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In summary, this report reinforces the idea that data science and machine learning require careful
                  attention to model selection, variable selection, and data handling techniques. Different models and
                  preprocessing techniques can lead to very different results, so a thoughtful and iterative approach is
                  necessary to arrive at the most accurate and effective model for a given problem.

                  NHL teams are big business, and they spend a lot of time and money on player selection. Each team can
                  only dress two goaltenders, so selecting performative players is essential. Our goal was to take an
                  approach to goaltender evaluation and performance prediction using data specific to individual
                  goaltenders in a specific season and excluding various team- and game-based factors that could not
                  only vary from year to year, but team to team, and game to game for a specific goaltender.

                  Our approach to solving this problem involved the use of Multiple Linear Regression Model, written in
                  R, that predicts an individual goalie’s save percentage based on their attributes. We used data
                  visualization (ggplot) and statistical analysis to identify cutoff values for ‘games played’ to
                  improve consistency. We manually conducted backward elimination model selection, resulting in a valid
                  interactive model that outperformed automated step-wise selection in terms of RMSE and R squared adj.

                  We used Multiple Linear Regression Model to predict an individual goaltender’s save percentage. The
                  model was developed in R programming language, and we used ggplot for data visualization. To improve
                  the consistency of our predictions, we identified the cutoff values for ‘games played’ through
                  statistical analysis. The model was then manually optimized through backward elimination model
                  selection, which resulted in a more accurate model compared to the automated step-wise selection
                  process.

                  Our project demonstrated the feasibility of using Multiple Linear Regression Model to predict the save
                  percentage of NHL goaltenders based on their individual attributes. Our approach showed an improvement
                  in the accuracy of predictions compared to the traditional methods. The model was optimized through

                  In this project, I explored the use of Multiple Linear Regression to evaluate and predict the
                  performance of NHL goaltenders. I encountered some challenges along the way, such as realizing that
                  the response variable of our model, save percentage, was better modeled with a sigmoidal curve rather
                  than a linear model. However, since advanced statistical models were beyond the scope of the class, we
                  continued to work with multiple linear regression.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Despite its limitations, our model was reasonably effective, with an adjusted R-squared value of 0.4,
                  and produced results that were within the acceptable range of values for the response variable.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Through this project, I gained a deeper understanding of the importance of proper model selection for
                  specific problems, the process of feature selection and model development, and the significance of
                  model diagnostics through assumption testing. I also learned about the limitations and strengths of
                  multiple linear regression models and how they can be used in real-world applications.

                  determine if the COVID-19 pandemic created a significant change in emergency shelter occupancy and if

                  This project provides valuable information on the impact of societal events on emergency shelter
                  occupancy in Alberta. The results of the Simple Linear Regression Model and the Analysis of Difference
                  of Proportion help to understand the trend in emergency shelter occupancy rates and the proportion of
                  women seeking emergency shelter during the COVID-19 pandemic and the 2014 oil downturn. The findings
                  of the project can be useful for policymakers, government agencies, and organizations working to
                  address the issue of homelessness. </p>
                <p>
                  This project served again as a great learning tool or me. As my first foray into linear regression and
                  proportion analysis, I learned a great deal about the limitations of strength of each moethod. Again
                  here, our analysis suffers from the fact that we were given a set of tools and looked for a problem to
                  solve with them, rather than identifying a problem and selecting the best method to solve it. In this
                  case, knowledge of time-series analysis would have made out analysis more meaningful. </p>
                <p>
                  It was interesting to see that the proportion of emergency occupants in womans shelters did increase
                  in the covid-19 pandemic, but that following the pandemic that proportion hit all time lows. This is
                  especially interesting when you consider that while emergency shelter occupancy rates were dropping
                  steadily in 6 years prior to the pandemic. </p>
